### SECTION 1 ###

To make sure the tool works properly, there are some requirements that have to be met.
1. You need to have Python installed on your PC, and Python has to be added to Windows Path.
2. You need to have PIP installed, and PIP needs to be added to Windows Path.

### SECTION 2 ###

How to check if you satisfy the above requirements?
1. Open Start (left down corner, Windows icon)
2. Type "cmd" -> hit Enter -> New "Command Prompt" window should open
3. In that new window type: "python --version" (without quotes)
3.1 If you see a message about your python version it's ok, else install Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and while installing remember to select "Add Python to PATH variables".
You may need IT Department people do it, because it may require system administrator rights.
4. If point 3 failed, point 4 will fail as well. However, in the same window type: "pip --version" (without quotes)
4.1 If you see a message about your pip version it's ok, else while installing Python make sure PIP is being installed too, and is being added to PATH variables as well.

### SECTION 3 ###

Once everything is installed on your machine, you can repeat the steps from SECTION 2, to see if Python and PIP are recognized by your system.

### SECTION 4 ###

Once the above works, "_INSTALL_ME" script should work properly, and you need to execute it only ONCE, after downloading this tool.

### SECTION 5 ###

After everything has been configured properly, you need to keep using "RUN_SCRIPT" only to use the tool.
